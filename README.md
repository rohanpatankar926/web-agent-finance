# 🧠 AI WEB Agent — Streamlit App

This is a simple and smart web app where AI agents work together to help you search the web and get financial information — all from one input box.

## What Can It Do?

This app is powered by **two specialized AI agents**:

1. **Finance Agent** – Great for anything related to:
   - Stock prices
   - Analyst recommendations
   - Company info
   - News about companies

2. **Web Agent** – Helps you search the internet for general topics using DuckDuckGo 🌐

Both agents work as a **team**, so you get clean, well-organized answers — often in tables, and always with sources included.
